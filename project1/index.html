            <h2 class="subtitle">The Lightning Thief</h2>
            <div class="summary"> Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.</div>

            <div class="bonusinfo">Since its publication in 2005, the book and its franchise have spawned adaptations ranging from graphic novels to two movies that departed largely from the books, and soon a Disney+ series as well. After the conclusion of Percy Jackson & the Olympians, the universe was expanded on in two sequel series, The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo, which feature many of the same characters.</div>

            <section class="final"> <div class="column">The Percy Jackson series is definitely a media I’d consider formative in my elementary years. I remember reading the Heroes of Olympus books as they came out (even though I’ve actually never finished the series, I’m pretty sure). I grew up loving Greek mythology, though, so I think it’s only natural that I would end up liking these novels so much. It’s been a long time since I picked up any of the books in the series, so I’m extremely fuzzy on the details. I still remember the names of a lot of the characters, though, even if I don’t remember exact plot points. Riordan wonderfully distinguishes each and every character and makes them unique, even lovable. </div>
            <div class="column">I remember noting that the way it tackled learning disabilities and recontextualized them as sort of superpowers for the children of the gods was really cool and so unique, and even very progressive for the time period it was published in. I have a great appreciation for the way it modernized Greek mythology and brought it into a North American setting. Every subsequent book does a great job of following the guidelines set by the first book, yet still expanding the universe to immerse young readers. The novels even have a likely intended side effect of educating its audience on Greek mythology, and I still remember some random trivia that I know I picked up from the Percy Jackson books. With the release of the Disney+ show soon, I’m sure many new fans will be brought into the fandom for a book I view quite fondly.</div>
