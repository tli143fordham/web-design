        <h4>Emu</h4>
        <p>This sounds generic, but I’ve always been interested in website design in some way or another. In middle school, I was big on making my own blog on Tumblr, which allowed you to customize your own HTML and CSS, so I spent a lot of time figuring out what commands meant what and how to adjust things just the way I liked them. Even before this class, I was also very familiar with using Inspect Element on websites to screw around and make jokes, but getting to know all of that with more familiarity in this class was a lot of fun. </p>

        <h4>Rui</h4>
        <p>Whenever I'm given the freedom to do whatever I want in my assignments, I tend to infuse my interests into everything, so getting to express myself in that way through my websites was also something I really appreciated in this class that I don’t usually get to do in other classes. I think, personally, being able to do that also made the assignments that much more engaging and helped me comprehend the material more deeply, as I wanted to be ambitious and try new things with everything I made.</p>

        <p>In my quest to put down in code the exact designs I had in mind, I ended up doing a lot of outside research and putting in the time to be extremely particular about my designs (I’ve had a lot of times where I went pixel by pixel changing the size of an element). I also really enjoyed being able to do my own illustrations and assets for the websites I made. I feel like adding that personalized element added a lot to my website, and I had a lot of fun drawing for them and bringing my vision to life. </p>

        <p>Overall, the exercises we did were a great way for me to have fun with the sites I make and really served as a good introduction to the realm of coding, which I had jokingly sworn off previously. I definitely want to do more website design in the future, and delve more into other languages if possible, now that I know what is possible with coding. Seeing the sites everyone else made were a great source of inspiration, and I loved being able to take a peek into everyone’s “worlds”, as corny as that sounds. For me, at least, the websites really ended up being a reflection of myself and the aesthetics I liked.</p>
