            <p>I think Chimero made his point very clear near the beginning of the essay, where he discusses adapting even the simplest of websites, like the Moby Dick example and making it responsive. It seems that the more complicated websites are (even with the most minute changes), the harder it is to make them responsive, which seems pretty self-explanatory. <br><br>While making this very website that this text is displayed on, I thought a little bit about my own website building process, and how I tend to err towards the side of “make everything pretty and silly and fun” while not really considering the user's experience. In this case, I feel like it's a little more excusable since I feel like this is an opportunity for me to really practice everything I've learned and have fun with it at the same time, making something that I enjoy making. At the same time, however, these principles don't translate all that well into more practical website design. <br><br>Chimero really stresses the importance of basic design principles in the essay, many of which I had previously been aware of, just because they are basic principles by nature. The human eyes and brain are led around a webpage in a certain fashion, and the hierarchy of design is very much applicable to web design, especially since most of the time only parts of a web page are visible at once.<br><br>Chimero leads into this point when he starts talking about Hockney's work in photography and how webpages can extend outwards in an “edgeless” fashion. In my case (or on this site), I’d hope the user can hopefully figure out where to go just based on visual cues, such as the pointer changing when hovering over something that is clickable or maybe even a color change in text when something is interacted with. Maybe they might even find secrets hidden in the code by changing the resolution of their browser. I think the game consoles I chose to replicate on this website kind of abide by this design choice as well, what with the Wii Menu expanding across multiple pages seamlessly.</p></div>
