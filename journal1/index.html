            <p>When I was in elementary school, there was some strange phase where everyone was obsessed with building their own websites, like on Wix and Weebly and whatnot. I don't remember what I filled mine with, because it was actually over 10 years ago, but I remember being very enamored with the different drag-and-drop widgets I could place on my site. I also remembered I tried embedding a Flash game simulating running a sushi restaurant onto my site, and being very proud of it working even though I think it was just a matter of copying and pasting.

            <p>The same goes for the Tumblr blog I once had, of which I spent many a night fine-tuning the HTML code I had grabbed from a code template blog to curate it to my very specific interests. What I think a website all comes down to is what the creator wants to do with it, much like any other kind of art. Nowadays, there are tools much more modern and streamlined for creating personal websites or social media bios, such as Carrd. It's just another method of self-expression, and as long as these “website-building websites” exist, I'll have a lasting version of myself on the internet in some way too.</p>

            <p>I think it's a lot of fun trying to make some things look as silly as possible, and if I have the opportunity to put 15 glitter text GIFs in quick succession on something I make, I absolutely will. These types of websites are probably… somewhat out of fashion now, a relic of the past. I don't think websites as a whole will become obsolete, however. It's just too broad of a term. I can't imagine what a current website would be replaced by, other than just simply a Better Version of a website. </p>
